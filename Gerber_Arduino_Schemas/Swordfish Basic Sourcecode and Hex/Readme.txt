Swordfish basic can be downloaded here:

http://www.sfcompiler.co.uk/

there is a free version however it is limited to using only 256 bytes of microcontroller SRAM.
Retroball requires around 600 bytes of SRAM and therefore you would need the full version of
Swordfish basic to compile the code.The full version is around $100 I think.
